# S³FD: Single Shot Scale-invariant Face Detector

### Introduction

S³FD is a real-time face detector, which performs superiorly on various scales of faces with a single deep neural network, especially for small faces. For more details, please refer to our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05237).
This repository intends to reproduce the results of the aforementioned paper.
